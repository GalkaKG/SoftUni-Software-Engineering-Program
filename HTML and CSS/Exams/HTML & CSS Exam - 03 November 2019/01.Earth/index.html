        Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object
        known to harbor life. According to radiometric dating and other sources
        of evidence, Earth formed over 4.5 billion years ago. Earth's axis of
        rotation is tilted with respect to its orbital plane, producing seasons
        on Earth. The gravitational interaction between Earth and the Moon
        causes tides, stabilizes Earth's orientation on its axis, and gradually
        slows its rotation.
